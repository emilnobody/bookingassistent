'Okay, the user is asking about reserving a bus ride from Fischerinsel to Marienstraße on the upcoming Tuesday at 8:00 AM. I need to extract the relevant entities from their query.\n\nFirst, the "from" location is Fischerinsel. Then, the "to" location is Marienstraße. The "date" is the upcoming Tuesday, which I can represent as "2023-10-24" assuming today is October 23, 2023. The "time" is 08:00, so I\'ll format that as "08:00:00".\n\nI should structure this into a JSON object with keys from, to, date, and time. Each key will have the corresponding value. I\'ll make sure the output is clean and can be parsed by JSON without any extra information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  "from": "Fischerinsel",\n  "to": "Marienstraße",\n  "date": "2023-10-24",\n  "time": "08:00:00"\n}\n```'
