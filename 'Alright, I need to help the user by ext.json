'Alright, I need to help the user by extracting specific entities from their query. The user is asking about reserving a bus ride from Fischerinsel to Marienstraße on a future day at a specific time. \n\nFirst, I\'ll identify the key parts. The "from" location is Fischerinsel, and the "to" location is Marienstraße. The date isn\'t specified, so I\'ll leave that as \'none\'. The time is given as 08:00, so that goes into the "time" field. \n\nI should make sure the output is in JSON format without any extra information. The user wants it concise, so I\'ll avoid any explanations or additional details. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have keys for from, to, date, and time with the corresponding values extracted from the query. That should meet the user\'s needs effectively.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  "from": "Fischerinsel",\n  "to": "Marienstraße",\n  "date": "none",\n  "time": "08:00"\n}\n```'
