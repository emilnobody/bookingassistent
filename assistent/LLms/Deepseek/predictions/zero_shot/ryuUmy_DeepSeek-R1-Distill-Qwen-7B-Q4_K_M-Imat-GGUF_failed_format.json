        "failed_format": "Okay, so I need to figure out if there's a connection from Bremen Rathaus to HafenCity Hamburg on October 12th at 11:30 AM. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the public transport routes in Germany, but I'll try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Bremen is a city in northern Germany, and HafenCity Hamburg is a large complex in Hamburg, which is to the southeast. So, they're pretty far apart. I'm not sure if there's a direct train or bus connecting them. Maybe there's a connection through another city? I've heard of the Autobahn network, but I don't think that's relevant here since we're talking about public transport.\n\nI should check if there's a train line that goes from Bremen to Hamburg. I remember that Bremen has a main station, and Hamburg has several, like Elbphilharmonie or HafenCity's own station. Maybe there's a train that goes from Bremen's main station to Hamburg's Elbphilharmonie station. If that's the case, then perhaps the connection would be through that route.\n\nNext, the date is October 12th, and the time is 11:30 AM. I'm not sure if that's a typical time for a train to run. I think trains usually have specific schedules, maybe hourly or every 30 minutes. I'm not certain about the exact departure times from Bremen on that day, but I can assume that if there's a train, it might run around that time.\n\nI also need to consider if there's a direct route or if it's a transfer. Sometimes, you have to change lines or transfer to a different train. If there's a direct connection, that would be ideal, but if not, maybe there's a way to transfer at another station along the way.\n\nI should also think about the duration. From Bremen to Hamburg is a long distance, so the travel time might be several hours. I'm not sure if a train can make that in one go, or if it's more of a bus route that might take longer. But since the user is asking about a connection, I'll assume it's a train or bus service.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the frequency of services. If it's a regular train, it might run on a specific schedule, but if it's a special service, maybe it's only on certain days or at certain times. I don't have that"
